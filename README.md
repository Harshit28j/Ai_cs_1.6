# AI_cstirke
I have created an AI program to play game. The AI will be able to control the game by itself. The AI could work as a team with human player and make them win the game.

To use this you need to have pyauogui, keyboard modules first Steps to intall pyauogui:

Press start + r
In run window type the following "pip install pyautogui"
In run window type the following "pip install keyboard"
Remember 2nd and 3rd you're good to go :D
