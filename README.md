## Description
The Color-Based AI Radar is an innovative program designed to enhance your gameplay experience in Counter-Strike 1.6. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, this radar system provides real-time visual scanning of the screen, enabling automatic targeting and shooting when certain color criteria are met.

### How It Works
The AI Radar employs screen reading techniques to analyze the pixels on the screen continuously. It scans each pixel's red (R), green (G), and blue (B) values and compares them to a predefined threshold. If all three color values are below 50, the program recognizes it as a target and automatically initiates a precise shot. This advanced color-based approach ensures accurate identification of specific objects or characters, helping you gain a competitive edge in the game.

### Key Features
- Real-time Color Scanning: The program continuously monitors the screen, identifying relevant targets based on their RGB color values.
- Threshold-based Detection: By setting the threshold at 50 for each color channel, the AI Radar ensures reliable target recognition and minimizes false positives.
- Automated Shooting: Once a target meeting the color criteria is detected, the AI Radar precisely executes a shot, improving your responsiveness and accuracy.
- Customizable Thresholds: You have the flexibility to adjust the color thresholds according to your preferences, allowing for customization and optimization of the radar's performance.
- Lightweight and Efficient: The AI Radar is designed to have minimal impact on system resources, ensuring smooth gameplay without any noticeable performance degradation.

### Getting Started
To use the Color-Based AI Radar, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., Python, pyautogui, PIL,Pillow).
2. **Configuration**: Customize the color thresholds in the configuration file to suit your preferences and gameplay style.
3. **Launch**: Execute the main script to start the AI Radar and let it run in the background while playing Counter-Strike 1.6.
4. **Enjoy**: Experience the benefits of the AI Radar as it autonomously detects and eliminates targets based on their color.
